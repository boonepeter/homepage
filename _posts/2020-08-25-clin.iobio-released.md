We are excited to announce our brand new app, <a href="https://clin.iobio.io/"> clin.iobio! </a> Clin.iobio provides a comprehensive and guided workflow to review sequencing data and report impactful variants. Clin.iobio also helps prioritize variants based on multiple integrated gene:disease association algorithms and knowledge bases.  We hope our new comprehensive genomic analysis app will help clinical teams diagnose current and future patients!

You can try out <a href="https://clin.iobio.io/"> clin.iobio </a> right now using a demo dataset.  Or you can immediately plug in your own data, by providing URLs to your BAM and VCF files. 

From the <a href="https://clin.iobio.io/"> clin.iobio </a> landing page, you can import your data into the app using the provided screen prompts for entering data URLs or a configuration file (from a previous analysis).
Our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVWiTlNY7yM">screencast </a> will help guide you through these options.

Clin.iobio is also easily launchable through genomic data platforms such as <a href="https://frameshift.io/"> Mosaic </a> by Frameshift. Using Mosaic, a user can immediately launch a project into clin.iobio to review genes or variants. 

Here are the main clin.iobio workflow steps:

### Review case:
Review relatedness, clinical notes sequencing data, and quality metrics (read coverage distribution and variant types).

### Define phenotypes:
Enter a clinical note and select the suspected genetic disorders and/or phenotypes. Terms are automatically extracted and a disease-prioritized gene list is provided for review in the next step.

### Review variants:
Review variants from your entered gene or variant list. You can review variants and attach a significance to any loaded variant.

### Report findings:
You can report your findings from all aspects of the workflow, including any reviewed variants. Within the “Report Findings” step you can export a PDF report. You can also find relevant drug information for the genes in your report. You can also download a file to immediately resume your analysis at a later time.
